# Hackathon_M1
A repository can be created and launched on the internet in this part. In this way, it is very easy for all team members to see and change the code at the same time. Based on this, you have a pipeline that integrates all the parts of the process.

## For creating your team's group repository, please follow these steps:
1. After a member of your team creates a gitHub repository, others can be invited to it.
Use this link for more info (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

2. Send an invitation for adding other team members as contributors to the repository. Use the setting tab and collaborators part in the left menu. Use add people button for adding team members to the repository. Use their GitHub username for inviting.

3. Create a new colab notebook and save it in the repository







4. Upload your data in the repository, if you have data locally you can upload it to the repository.


5. In the repository, create app.py and requirements.txt files




6. Launch your application through the streamlit server




So now you have an integrated pipeline that you can easily complete your analysis in colab notebook and after that using app.py you can deploy your streamlit application.
